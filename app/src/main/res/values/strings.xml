        <b>Welcome to orWall!</b>\n
        This wizard will let you learn what orWall can do and what it cannot. It will also give you some
        hints on what might or might not be done.\n
        \n
        <b>orWall is not a firewall</b>\n
        Keep it in mind. orWall will not replace AFWall nor DroidWall nor anything like that.\n
        orWall main aim is to allow you forcing apps though some local proxy when those apps don\'t
        know how to talk to this proxy; it will also allow you to prevent any leaks, using an init-script.\n
        \n
        <b>How to use orWall</b>\n
        You will find three panels:\n
        - Home\n
        - Apps\n
        - Logs (which isn\'t available for now)\n
        \n
        On the Home panel, you will find some main settings.\n
        From there, you are able to deactivate orWall (until next reboot), activate Tethering support (by default,
        orWall rules block that usage), as well as give a temporary authorization to a web browser to bypass the whole proxy
        thing, enable SIP application to send UDP requests, and enable Local Area Network (LAN) connections.\n
        \n
        On the Apps panel, you will find a list of your installed applications.\n
        \n
        Bellow you will find some information about current orWall status. Note that some switches may be disabled.
        This happens if, for some reason, an option isn\'t available on your device. It is also true for read-only settings.
    </string>
    <string name="wizard_second">
        <b>Disable orWall</b>\n
        This option let you deactivate orWall. Just keep in mind the deactivation will ends once you reboot
        your device.
        \n
        <b>Enable tethering</b>\n
        You\'ll need to activate this option if you want to share your Internet connection from your device.\n
        Once this option is enabled, orWall will detect automatically when you enable the connection sharing, and
        activate a subset of firewall rules.\n
        \n
        It may take a while before this takes effect.\n
        <b>WARNING!</b> This option doesn\'t work as expected for now :(.\n
        \n
        <b>Authorize browser</b>\n
        This option allows you to lock up your device, while still being able to authenticate to some
        captive portal (like in hotels). An application you select through Settings>Special Applications
        will get an unlimited access to the network for a give time.\n
        Once you enable this option, a timer will start. Once it reaches the end of the grace time, the
        browser will be locked as previously.\n
        The grace time may be set in Settings>Network. Default value is 5 minutes.\n
        \n
        <b>Enable SIP</b>\n
        Toggling this option will allow a selected application to access remote hosts using UDP protocol.\n
        \n
        <b>Enable LAN connections</b>\n
        This will let you access to your Local Area Network.
    </string>
    <string name="wizard_third">
        <b>Default behavior</b>\n
        When you touch an app in the "Apps" tab, it will toggle its status: either the app can access the Net
        using Orbot, or it\'s locked out.\n
        The list view will refresh eventually when you come back to orWall later (this must be improved).\n
        \n
        <b>Advanced settings</b>\n
        A long touch will display a dialog in order to let you configure a bit more the app accesses.\n
        The following options are available for now:\n
        - Connection provider: let you chose between Tor and… well, Tor for now.\n
        - Connection type: either the application can be configured in order to use a local proxy, or you\'ll need
        to force it through the proxy.\n
        - Complete bypass: this option shouldn\'t be use at all, as it will allow the application to bypass completely
        your proxy, for life.\n
        \n
        <b>Forced connection</b>\n
        It uses iptables REDIRECT target in order to force the application through local proxy\n
        It will be shown on the application list as "TransProxy via [proxy]".\n
        \n
        <b>Fenced connection</b>\n
        This is for application aware of proxy settings. Some applications like Twidere, Lightning or ChatSecure
        already embed settings allowing you to make them go through Orbot or other proxies.\n
        Selecting this option in orWall will allow such application to connect to the Proxy, while preventing them to connect
        to other services.\n
        Imagine this option as a fenced road: You may access freely the content of the road, but you can\'t go elsewhere.
